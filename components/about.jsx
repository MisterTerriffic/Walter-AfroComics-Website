          [Website Title] is website dedicated to the chronically the history of
          black comic book creators, their content, their characters, and their
          stories. Throughout history people of color have had to create their
          own space for themselves as access to them in the world were limited
          to them. Here we showcase, inform, expose, and sell content made by
          black creators who have had to make their own on their own terms. We
          auction off any rare items and sell content from comics books, toys,
          action figures, Funko pops, and more. People in the minority need
          places where they can celebrate themselves and see themselves we
          provide a space from independent creators plus more. .
