    about: "The Boondocks, a strip that took the syndication world by storm, catapulted its creator, Aaron McGruder, to fame. He graced the covers of prestigious publications like Time magazine and People magazine, where he was recognized as one of the “25 Most Intriguing People of ’99.” The strip centers around the adventures of two young African-American boys, Huey and Riley, as they embark on a journey from the inner-city Chicago to the suburbs, or as they call it, the “boondocks.” The unique blend of hip-hop sensibilities, Japanese anime-style drawings, and a candid discussion of race makes the Boondocks a truly one-of-a-kind comic strip. Its humor and insight are both entertaining and thought-provoking, making it a must-read for anyone who appreciates exceptional art and boundary-pushing content.",
