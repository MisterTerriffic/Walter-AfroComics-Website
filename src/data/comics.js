Reporter Rob Chaplik serves as an audience surrogate, her outsider perspective shedding light on the initial apprehension and assumptions surrounding the group, particularly in the context of the inner-city environment. The narrative emphasizes the group’s enigmatic past and the unexplained nature of their powers, which are attributed to the Big Bang event.",
