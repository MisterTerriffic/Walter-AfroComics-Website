        <h2>Website Title</h2>
        <p> Website Title] is website dedicated to the chronically the history of black comic book creators, their content, their characters, and their stories.
             Throughout history people of color have had to create their own space for themselves as access to them in the world were limited to them. Here we 
             showcase, inform, expose, and sell content made by black creators who have had to make their own on their own terms. We auction off any rare items 
             and sell content from comics books, toys, action figures, Funko pops, and more. People in the minority need places where they can celebrate 
             themselves and see themselves we provide a space from independent creators plus more. .</p>
